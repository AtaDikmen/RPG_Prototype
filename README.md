First RPG Project


Using the Udemy courses I have taken, I attempted to create a prototype of a role-playing game (RPG) for the first time. In this process, which lasted for a couple of weeks, I learned the mechanics and fundamentals of RPGs.

The fundamental logic of the game is to eliminate a bandit camp. Within the game, we have two different types of weapons: one is a sword, and the other is a bow. Additionally, there is a health elixir that we can utilize by pressing the E key.

I have included a few screenshots from the game:
